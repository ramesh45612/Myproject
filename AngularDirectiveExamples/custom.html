<h4>Pass data into isolated directives@</h4>
@  Used to pass a string value into the directive<br>
<isolated-scope1 first="{{firstName}}"></isolated-scope1><br>

<h4>Pass data into isolated directives=</h4>
=    Used to create a two-way binding to an object that is passed into the directive<br>
<isolated-scope2 customer="customer"></isolated-scope2><br>
Notice that with the = local scope property you dont pass {/{ customer }/} as with @. 
You instead pass the name of the property directly. In this example 
the customer object passed into the directive’s customer local scope property comes from the controller shown earlier<br><br>

<isolated-scope3 customer="customer" action="changeData()"></isolated-scope3><br><br>
